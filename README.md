# PACT Group 1
During the summer of 2021 I attended [PACT](https://algorithmicthinking.org/overview) with Dr. Rajiv Gandhi. Though it was virtual, I really enjoyed all the new concepts that I learned as part of group 1. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I took the second level, [group 2](https://github.com/asubramanian08/PACT-Group-2), the next year.

## Content
[PACT](https://algorithmicthinking.org/overview) group 1 is an introduction to theoretical computer science. Every day we alternate between topics in discrete math and topics in probability. In discrete math we study different methods of proof, systematic counting, and Big-O notation. The probability topics include conditional probability, independent events, and random variables. For more information about the group 1 class see [this](https://algorithmicthinking.org/overview) link.

## Organization
There is a folder representing each day of lectures. It includes:
* ClassLecture.pdf (*private*): The concepts written in LaTeX
* ClassNotes.pdf (*private*): Notes Dr. Gandhi creates in class
* HW_Answers.pdf (*optional*): My answers to the homework question
* HW_Comments.txt (*optional*): The comments given on my answers
* HW_Question.pdf (*private*, *optional*): The actual homework
* HW_Solution.pdf (*private*, *optional*): Correct answers to the homework
* RecitationNotes.pdf (*private*): Hand-drawn notes from recitation
* RecitationQuestions.pdf (*private*): problems discussed in recitation
* RecitationSolutions.pdf (*private*): answers to all those problems
